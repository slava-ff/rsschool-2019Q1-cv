I am a "pro-newbie" in front-end and back-end. That's my hobby, and I want to turn that in my profession. I think I'm capable to become a middle-dev or even a senior-dev in a couple of years, because I have an experience in becoming a really pro in marketing profession in 5 years, which is definitely not my real talent. As I realized that logic, math and alogorithms are my best talents, so I decided that in this sphere I'll become a pro much faster. I hope you will take this as the indicator of my motivation, but not as my self praise.

My skills: js, node.js, mongo.db, worked with WebStorm and in-built VCS

examples: later

Experience. my own big project "webchat", I'll add a link: with front-end, back-end and database

Education: Codecademy: HTML, CSS, W3C: JS, node.js, HTML, CSS, javascript.ru

English level: B2 in my own opinion / C1 - according to the "Streamline" test results. I often used my English in my job: I worked in a dealer of a foreign company for 5 years, and in my regular travels: USA, Europe and etc.

NOTE: all this data is real. 

best regards,
Slava

### About me
I am a "pro-newbie" in front-end and back-end. That's my hobby, and I want to turn that in my profession. I think I'm capable to become a middle-dev or even a senior-dev in a couple of years, because I have an experience in becoming a really pro in marketing profession in 5 years, which is definitely not my real talent. As I realized that logic, math and alogorithms are my best talents, so I decided that in this sphere I'll become a pro much faster. I hope you will take this as the indicator of my motivation, but not as my self praise.
